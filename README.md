# Elixir Forge
This is the first real game that I've ever made, and it was for the Pirate Software Game Jam 15.
I decided to make the source code public because it was essentially going to be public anyway (it's unobfuscated JS and HTML, so you could just read it in inspect), and that's just how I want this to work.
